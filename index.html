    <h2>History of javascript</h2>
    <p class="second">
      JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for
      Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape
      handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to
      develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was
      1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).
